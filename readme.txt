This modification will add icons on both sides of username in various areas.

Only admin has the permission to add/ change/ remove icons for the member groups.

Admins can even choose that on which side icon should be displayed, i.e. right of username or left of username or on both sides.

Even admins can choose which usergroup names will be shown in bold across various sections.


Area where bold username & icons will be displayed with username:

- in Header
- in Last Post of Board Index
- in Forum Stats on Board Index
- In online list on Board Index
- in Message index
- in Posts
- in Profile
- in Personal messages
- in memberlist
- in "who's online" 


Icons have to uploaded in default\images\group_images folder. Created a separate folder so that it will be easy to replace images afterwards if one wants to.

[quote]The "group_images" directory will be still be present in the images folder even after the uninstallation of the mod

themes/default/images/group_images

This is done on purpose so that if an admin re-installs the mod he can use the mod from last state where he uninstalled it.

If you wish you can remove the "group_images" directory after uninstalling the mod there is no harm in it.
