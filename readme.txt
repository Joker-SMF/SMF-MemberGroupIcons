This modification will add icons on both sides of username in various areas.

Only admin has the permission to add/ change/ remove icons for the member groups.

Admins can even choose that on which side icon should be displayed, i.e. right of username or left of username or on both sides.


Area where icons will be displayed with username:

- in Header
- in Last Post of Board Index
- in Forum Stats on Board Index
- In online list on Board Index
- in Message index
- in Posts
- in Profile
- in Personal messages
- in memberlist
- in "who's online" 


Icons have to uploaded in default\images\group_images folder. Created a separate folder so that it will be easy to replace images afterwards if one wants to.


After adding image or icon in group_images folder go to,

Administration Center » Membergroups » Edit Membergroups
Click on modify button next to member group name and add the icon name in "Icon/Image filename" field.


To enable or disable different permissions regarding mod go to,
Administration Center » Modification Settings » Member Group Icons
