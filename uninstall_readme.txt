The "group_images" directory will be still be present in the images folder even after the uninstallation of the mod

themes/default/images/group_images

This is done on purpose so that if an admin re-installs the mod he can use the mod from last state where he uninstalled it.

If you wish you can remove the "group_images" directory after uninstalling the mod there is no harm in it.
